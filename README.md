# NewSearchPageAndPlannerWebsite
## The Google search page is a little plain. This project will develop a new search page using google and will have additional features for the user.

## These are the features I plan to implement in this project
## Features:
- Responsive Background:
  - First stage this will be just a random image. Future Implementation will inlcude a random background from an array of images to display when the user opens the website
- Welcome Screen:
  - This will display a dynamic digital time and date along with a static welcome message
- Google Search Bar:
  - Will implement a google search bar so users can search the internet (Duh)
- Dynamic Calender with Planner Capabilities
  - I will develop a calendar which users can add things to the calendar, similar to how one would use a planner. The calendar will then display the tasks needed to do for each day. The calendar will also be interactive.
- Weather API:
  - Nothing completes a home page like displaying the weather for the day
- Spotify and News Integration:
  - This will be a really cool feature for the users, but it is not much of a priority.
- User Customization and Settings:
  - This will really boost up the user ability to interact with the web application
  

### This is just a project I am doing for fun. These features will be added based on the amount of time I have and the skill level I have. I hope to implement all of these features into making the most enjoyable experience for users when they use this web application. THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH!
